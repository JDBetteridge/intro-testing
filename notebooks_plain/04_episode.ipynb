    "In the previous lesson we wrote our function with its assertion in `ipython`. As we have discussed previously, it is much more useful to write these as a script which we can then call, or in the case of libraries import. In this lesson we will write our mean function as a script and revise how to display documentation and call the function.  We will then expore how to include our own libraries within other scripts revise why it is good practice to include the main part of the script in its own function.\n",

    "If you have not already created a directory `my_testing` in your `intro-testing` directory, do so and `cd` into it. Then create a new file called `mean.py`.  You are free to use the editor of your choice, e.g. `nano` or others on `linux`, however we would also like to introduce `notepad++` which may be more familiar to Windows users, and highlights code which can help us ensure we have the correct syntax.  Note that this will not be available on remote linux machines so you should be confident to use editors like `nano` if required."
